            <li>The total <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assets_under_management">Assets Under Management</a> (AUM) of the Indian mutual fund industry as of December 31, 2023,
                stood at a staggering ₹50.78 trillion (US$600 billion). This is a significant milestone, marking over a
                six-fold increase compared to the ₹8.26 trillion (US$98 billion) recorded in December
                2013.<sup>[2]</sup></li>
            <li>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Board_of_India">SEBI</a>, during FY 2022-23, 73% of mutual fund units were redeemed within 2 years of
                investment. Only investments in 3% of the units continued for more than 5 years.<sup>[3][4]</sup></li>
            <li>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India">Reserve Bank of India</a> report, mutual funds attracted 6% of household savings in FY2023
                and less than 1% went into direct equities.<sup>[5][6][7]</sup> Almost 95% of household savings in India
                park their money in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_account">bank deposits</a>, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_deposit">fixed deposit</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provident_fund">provident fund</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Provident_Fund_(India)">PPF</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_insurance">life insurance</a>, and

            <li>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_Global_Ratings">S&P</a> SPIVA Report FY2022, over a 10-year period, approximate 68% of the large-cap
                actively managed funds failed to beat their respective benchmarks, and over 50% failed to beat their
                benchmarks in the mid- and small-cap segments.<sup>[8]</sup> Within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_Linked_Savings_Scheme">ELSS</a> funds category, over 60%
                failed to beat their respective benchmarks over 10 year period.<sup>[8]</sup> Globally, over long
                periods of time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_management">passively managed funds</a> consistently outperform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_management">actively managed</a>

        <h2 id="2020">2020 franklin templeton mutual fund fiasco <span style="color: blue;">[ edit ]</span> </h2>

        <p>In April 2020, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Templeton_Investments">Franklin Templeton</a> India unexpectedly wound up six credit funds with assets of close to $4
            billion, citing a lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_crisis">liquidity</a> amid the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">coronavirus pandemic</a>. These funds had large exposure to
            higher-yielding, lower-rated credit securities. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Board_of_India">Securities and Exchange Board of India</a> (SEBI) conducted
            a probe into this sudden closure and found “serious lapses and violations”. As a result, in June 2021, SEBI
            barred Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund from launching any new debt schemes for two years. The regulator also
            ordered the fund house to refund investment and advisory fees, along with interest, of more than 5 billion
            rupees, and fined the global giant another 50 million rupees.<sup>[15][16][17][18]</sup>

            Franklin Templeton said it strongly disagreed with the SEBI’s order and planned to appeal against it. The
            decision to wind up the schemes “was taken with the sole objective of preserving value for unitholders”, a
            spokesperson said. However, the closure of these funds sparked panic withdrawals from other Franklin
            Templeton schemes as well as credit funds of other asset managers, leading to a storm on social media and
            court cases by distraught investors.<sup>[18][15][17]</sup></p><br>

        <h2 id="reliance">Reliance Mutual funds <span style="color: blue;">[ edit ]</span></h2>

        <p>In 2019, the debt schemes of Reliance Mutual Fund faced a liquidity crisis due to their exposure to troubled
            companies like Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL). This led to severe redemptions and forced asset
            sales, which significantly affected investors.<sup>[19][20]</sup></p><br>

        <h2 id="il">IL & FS crisis <span style="color: blue;">[ edit ]</span></h2>

        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Leasing_%26_Financial_Services">IL&FS</a> crisis in 2018 had a significant impact on the mutual fund industry, including those managed by
            IDBI Mutual Fund. The defaults by IL&FS led to a series of downgrades and defaults on its debt obligations
            and inter-corporate deposits1. This situation caused considerable distress in the financial markets and led
            to significant markdowns in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the affected mutual fund schemes, resulting in
            losses to investors.<sup>[21][22][23]</sup>

            The defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) triggered a liquidity crisis, making it
            difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption demands without selling assets at distressed prices. This
            event heightened concerns about credit risk, leading to widespread downgrades of IL&FS and other non-banking
            financial companies (NBFCs). Consequently, the net asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these
            securities were adversely affected, reflecting the increased credit risk and decreased market
            confidence.<sup>[24][25][26][27]</sup>

            Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, particularly those with high exposure to NBFCs and infrastructure
            debt, was severely undermined. This led to significant outflows as investors moved towards safer and more
            liquid investment options. In response, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced
            stricter regulations on sectoral exposure, single issuer limits, and the quality of collateral accepted in
            debt funds to enhance liquidity and reduce risks. Fund managers began focusing on higher-quality assets and
            improved risk management practices. The crisis underscored the need for better credit assessment and
            liquidity management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious investment approach within the mutual
            fund industry.<sup>[24][25][26][27]</sup></p><br>

        <h2 id="amtek">Amtek auto impact <span style="color: blue;">[ edit ]</span></h2>

        <p>Several mutual funds, including those managed by JP Morgan Asset Management India, faced significant issues
            due to exposure to Amtek Auto, which defaulted on its debt in 2015. JP Morgan had to suspend redemptions and
            impose exit loads to manage the liquidity crisis.<sup>[28][29][30]</sup></p><br>

        <h2 id="birla">Birla Sun life mutual fund (aditya birla sun life mutual fund) <span style="color: blue;">[ edit ]</span></h2>

        <p>In 2018, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund faced redemption pressures in some of its debt schemes due to
            exposure to entities like the Essel Group companies. The Economic Times reported that the Aditya Birla Sun
            Life Mutual Fund was the biggest investor in the Essel Group, with an exposure of Rs 2,936 crore spread
            across 28 schemes1. This accounted for almost 37% of the total debt fund exposure to the Zee group, which is
            part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essel_Group">Essel Group</a>.<sup>[31]</sup></p><br>

        <h2 id="dewan">Dewan Housing finance corporation(DHFL) crisis and impact <span style="color: blue;">[ edit ]</span></h2>

        <p>The Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis had a profound impact on the Indian mutual fund industry.
            DHFL's defaults created a severe liquidity crunch, making it difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption
            pressures without selling assets at heavily discounted prices. This crisis raised significant concerns about
            the creditworthiness of housing finance companies (HFCs) and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs),
            leading to downgrades of DHFL's debt instruments and adversely affecting the net asset values (NAVs) of
            mutual funds holding these securities.<sup>[32][33][34][35]</sup>

            Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, especially those with high exposure to HFCs and NBFCs, was
            severely shaken, resulting in substantial outflows as investors sought safer investments. In response, the
            Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) increased scrutiny and introduced tighter regulations on
            mutual funds' exposure to individual issuers and sectors to mitigate such risks in the future. Fund managers
            adjusted their portfolios by shifting towards higher-quality and more liquid assets, reducing exposure to
            high-risk debt instruments. The crisis underscored the importance of credit quality and liquidity
            management, prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious approach within the mutual fund
            industry.<sup>[32][33][34][35]</sup></p><br>

        <h2 id="2001">2001 UTI mutual fund (Unit Trust of india) fiasco <span style="color: blue;">[ edit ]</span></h2>

        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTI_Asset_Management">The Unit Trust of India</a> (UTI) faced a significant crisis in 2001, which was primarily due to large-scale
            redemption pressures and mismanagement, particularly in its flagship scheme, US-6412. The crisis was
            exacerbated by the Ketan Parekh scam, which caused a sharp decline in stock prices, leading to mutual funds,
            including UTI’s schemes, suffering severe consequences.<sup>[36][37][38]</sup>

            The government intervened to protect investors and restructured UTI. This restructuring led to the
            bifurcation of UTI into two separate entities in 2003: the UTI Mutual Fund (now managed by the UTI Trustee
            Company Pvt. Ltd.) and the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), which took over the
            assets and liabilities of the erstwhile UTI12. The government’s intervention included a bailout package to
            stabilize the situation and ensure the protection of investors’ interests.<sup>[36][37][38]</sup></p>

        <h2 id="dhfl">DHFL pramerica mutual fund <span style="color: blue;">[ edit ]</span></h2>

        <p>Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) defaulted on its debt obligations in 2019. This event led to
            significant governance concerns and defaults by DHFL in meeting various payment obligations, prompting the
            Reserve Bank of India to supersede the Board of Directors of DHFL1. The default affected several mutual
            funds, including those managed by BNP Paribas Asset Management India Private Limited, which had to mark down
            the value of their investments in DHFL’s securities.<sup>[39][40][32][35]</sup>

            The crisis deepened with rating downgrades and write-offs by mutual funds, which had a cumulative exposure
            of ₹5,336 crore to securities issued by DHFL3. As a result, there was a severe liquidity issue and a drop in
            the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the mutual funds, impacting investors’ returns. DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund,
            which was a joint venture between DHFL and Pramerica Financial, Inc., also faced challenges due to the
            exposure to DHFL’s debt instruments.<sup>[39][40][32][35]</sup></p><br>

        <h2 id="yes">Yes mutual fund <span style="color: blue;">[ edit ]</span></h2>

        <p>In 2019, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Bank">Yes Bank</a> faced severe financial stress and was eventually placed under a moratorium by the Reserve
            Bank of India (RBI) in March 2020. This led to significant challenges for Yes Mutual Fund, particularly its
            debt schemes that had exposure to Yes Bank’s securities. The crisis necessitated write-downs and affected
            investor confidence. Around 32 mutual fund schemes had exposure to Yes Bank’s downgraded debt papers, with a
            total exposure amounting to approximately ₹2,848 crore. The crisis led to write-downs of these securities
            and impacted the net asset values (NAVs) of the mutual funds involved, which in turn affected investor
            confidence.<sup>[41][42][43]</sup></p><br>


        <h2 id="kotak">Kotak mutual fund <span style="color: blue;">[ edit ]</span></h2>

        <p>In 2019, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotak_Mutual_Fund">Kotak Mutual Fund</a> did face challenges with its Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) due to exposure to debt
            securities of companies like the Essel Group. The fund house was unable to redeem investments from these
            companies, which led to delays and partial rollovers of the FMPs. This situation affected the investors’
            expected returns. Consequently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) barred Kotak from
            launching new FMPs for six months and imposed a fine for failing to abide by regulatory
            requirements.<sup>[44]</sup></p><br>

        <h2 id="hdfc">HDFC mutual fund <span style="color: blue;">[ edit ]</span></h2>

        <p>HDFC Mutual Fund did face a situation in 2018-2019 due to its exposure to companies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essel_Group">Essel Group</a> and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Leasing_%26_Financial_Services">IL&FS</a>. The credit events involving these companies led to significant mark-downs in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Asset_Values">Net Asset Values</a>
            (NAVs) of some of HDFC Mutual Fund’s debt schemes. This situation resulted in investor concerns and
            redemption pressures.<sup>[45][46]</sup>

            To elaborate, the IL&FS crisis was one of the biggest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis">financial crises</a> in India, with the company defaulting
            on several of its obligations due to a cash shortfall. The debt involved was about Rs 1 lakh crore.
            Similarly, Essel Group companies were grappling with debt woes, which put mutual funds, including HDFC,
            under redemption pressure. However, HDFC Mutual Fund later recovered the entire investment made in the
            non-convertible debentures issued by Essel Group companies.<sup>[45][46]</sup></p><br>

        <h2 id="sahara">Sahara mutual funds <span style="color: blue;">[ edit ]</span></h2>

        <p>SEBI conducted an examination to determine whether Sahara Mutual Fund, its Asset Management Company, and its
            trustees were ‘fit and proper’ as per regulatory standards. This was in light of a previous SEBI order from
            2011 concerning two other Sahara entities, which were directed to refund money collected through Optionally
            Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) to investors.[47][48]

            In 2015, SEBI ordered the winding up of Sahara Mutual Fund’s schemes due to non-compliance with regulatory
            requirements. The regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges indeed led to operational difficulties and
            affected investor confidence in the fund house.<sup>[49][50]</sup></p><br>

        <h2>Market Segment <span style="color: blue;">[ edit ]</span></h2>

        <p>Despite being available in the market,[51] a recent report on Mutual Fund Investments in India published by
            research and analytics firm, Boston Analytics, suggests <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor">investors</a> are holding back from putting their money
            into mutual funds due to their perceived high risk and a lack of information on how mutual funds work.[52]
